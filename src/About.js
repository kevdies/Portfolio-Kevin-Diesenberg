            Aside from my passion for Full Stack Software Engineering, I have
            several hobbies that keep me active and energized. I love spending
            time outdoors and engaging in activities such as skydiving, road
            biking, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, bikepacking, and
            camping. My experience in the entertainment, outdoor, and skydiving
            industries has given me exceptional leadership and organizational
            skills.
